### 💡 **Lovable App Prompt: CreatorStack MVP (Explore + Product Submission Flow)**

I want to build a **web-based SaaS** called **CreatorStack** — a platform where digital creators can showcase their products, grow an audience, and optionally submit their content to a curated Explore page.

---

### ✅ **MVP Functional Scope**

#### 👥 1. **User Roles**

* Free Creator
* Premium Creator
* Admin

---

#### 🏠 2. **Public Pages**

##### 🔹 Homepage

* Hero section with platform value prop
* CTA: “Create your creator page”
* Preview of Explore content (top products)
* Benefits section

##### 🔹 Public Creator Profile (auto-generated)

* URL: `/u/username`
* Avatar, bio, social links
* Grid of added products (title, tags, link)
* Email form (only if Premium)
* Optional: badge like “Featured on CreatorStack”

---

#### 🧑‍💻 3. **Creator Dashboard**

Inside logged-in dashboard:

* Edit profile (bio, social links, avatar)
* Add/edit products:

  * Title, description, product link, tags (multi-tag)
  * Status: Draft, Submitted, Approved
  * Button: **“Submit for Explore”**
* View own public profile
* Upgrade to Premium (via Stripe)
* Access “Resources Hub” (Premium only)

---

#### 🌍 4. **Explore Page**

A public, SEO-optimized grid that shows:

* **Only approved products**
* Tag-based filters at the top:

  * Tags like: AI, Free, Template, Course, Notion, etc.
  * Clicking filters updates visible results
* Featured creators/products highlighted
* Each card shows:

  * Product title + short description
  * Creator avatar + name
  * Tags

---

#### 🧠 5. **Submission Workflow**

* Creators click “Submit for Explore” inside dashboard
* Product `status` changes to `submitted`
* This triggers an **n8n flow**:

  * Sends email to admin: “New product submitted by {creator}”
  * Includes link to review the product
* Admin views all submitted products (via Admin Dashboard or Lovable CMS)

  * Can approve → changes status to `approved`
  * Approved products appear on Explore page

---

#### 🛠️ 6. **Admin Dashboard (or CMS View)**

Admin should be able to:

* View all products (`draft`, `submitted`, `approved`)
* Approve or reject submissions
* Upload and manage premium-only resources (guides, PDFs, tools)
* View/filter creators by plan (Free, Premium)
* Manage tags and featured profiles

---

#### 🔐 7. **Premium Features**

* Unlock **Resources Hub**

  * Private dashboard tab
  * Admin-uploaded content: Notion docs, PDFs, tools
  * Filterable by format or topic
* Enable **Email Lead Form** on public profile
* (Optional) Priority in Explore Page sort order

---
